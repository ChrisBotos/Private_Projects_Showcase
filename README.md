## Botos Transcription Simulation

This private repository contains simulations of the biological process of transcription, developed as part of a research project in the lab of Dr. Matthieu Lavigne (IMBB-FORTH). 

### Features
- **Versions**: 10+ stable versions, each improving scalability and biological accuracy.
- **Highlights**:
  - Created in both Python and C.
  - Realistic biological stochastic modeling.
  - Modular and efficient codebase.
  - Optimized for performance (use of C).
  - Machine learning for hyperparameter tuning by comparing real data to that produced by the simulation.

### Want to Learn More?
The full codebase is private, but I’d be happy to discuss it during interviews or collaborations. Feel free to reach out!
