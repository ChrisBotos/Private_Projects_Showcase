# Private Projects Showcase

This repository serves as a showcase of my private projects. Below are descriptions of the projects I’ve worked on and can share more details upon request.

## Botos Transcription Simulation

This private repository contains simulations of the biological process of transcription, developed as part of a research project in the lab of Dr. Matthieu Lavigne (IMBB-FORTH). 

### Features
- **Versions**: 10+ stable versions, each improving scalability and biological accuracy.
- **Highlights**:
  - Created in both Python and C.
  - Realistic biological stochastic modeling.
  - Modular and efficient codebase.
  - Optimized for performance (use of C).
  - Machine learning for hyperparameter tuning by comparing real data to that produced by the simulation.

### Want to Learn More?
The full codebase is private, but I’d be happy to discuss it during interviews or collaborations. Feel free to reach out!

## I-R-Injury-Spatial-Multiomics-Analysis

This private repository was developed in collaboration with Benedetta Manzato as part of our work in the lab of PI Ahmed Mahfouz at the Human Genetics Department of the Leiden University Medical Center.

### Project Aim
Extract spatial features from mice kidney slices following Ischemia Reperfusion (I/R) Injury and use them to predict cellular functions over space and time.

### Highlights
- **Modalities**: Spatial transcriptomics, spatial metabolomics, and DAPI-based cell segmentation.
- **Focus**:
  - Morphological and spatial quantification of injury and repair processes.
  - Comparison across multiple post-I/R time points (10h, 2d, 14d).
  - Use of deep learning and engineered features to infer cell states.
  - Application of spatial statistics and machine learning for downstream analysis.

### Want to Learn More?
The codebase is private, but I’m happy to provide further details or discuss the methods during interviews or academic collaborations.
